Hi there!&nbsp;👋

I'm a ***Frontend Web Developer*** who loves to *design products* as well.

I studied a ***visual communication design*** at the uni and used to work as an 🌈***UXUI Designer***🌈&nbsp; at startups.

Currently studying for academy 🛍, in *** Busan, South Korea 🇰🇷***

Interested in ***TypeScript, React, Recoil, Angular***, these days...

And yeah, I'm a lunatic traveller! Can't wait till the next trip 🧚 &nbsp;! ~~(f**k COVID19!)~~
